**Machine Learning Model Comparison and Insights**

**Project Overview**

This project explores the performance of various regression models on a dataset with weak feature-target relationships. 
The goal was to identify the best-performing model while addressing the challenges posed by the dataset.

**Models Evaluated:**

- Linear Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Ridge Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- AdaBoost
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost

**Key Challenges:**

- Weak Multicollinearity: Features showed minimal relationships with the target variable, leading to low predictive power.
- Overfitting: Complex models like Decision Tree and XGBoost severely overfit the training data.
- Generalization Issues: Most models performed poorly on the test set, evidenced by negative or near-zero R² scores.

**Data Preprocessing Steps:**

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualized feature distributions and relationships with the target variable.
Identified weak correlations and potential outliers.

2. Feature Engineering:
Created polynomial and interaction terms.
Applied feature scaling (StandardScaler).

3. Model Evaluation:
Split data into training and test sets (70:30 ratio).
Used standardized metrics (R², RMSE, MAE) for comparison.
Applied GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

**Insights**

1. Linear Models:
Regularization (Lasso, Ridge) improved overfitting slightly but couldn't overcome data limitations.

2. KNN and Decision Trees:
Captured local patterns but overfitted the training data, leading to poor generalization.

3. Boosting Methods:
Gradient Boosting and XGBoost captured more training data patterns but overfit due to weak feature signals.

**Overall**

No model significantly outperformed others, highlighting the dataset’s limitations.

**Lessons Learned**

- Data Quality: High-quality features are essential for effective modeling.
- Model Complexity: Simpler models can perform better when data lacks strong signals.
- Feature Engineering: Even advanced models cannot compensate for missing or irrelevant features.

**Next Steps**

Unsupervised Learning: Explore clustering or PCA for latent patterns.
Domain Expertise: Seek additional data or domain insights to create meaningful features.
